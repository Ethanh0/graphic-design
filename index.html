                    <p><u>Axial</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/axial.jpg">
                    <p>Axial arranges elements on either side of a line or axis. Axial typographic systems are not always used on their own and can be combined with other typographic systems to make an engaging effect with the viewer.</p>
                    <p>In my image different blocks of text are arranged opposite each other, this is how the typographic system is used to draw in an audience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bilateral">
                    <p><u>Bilateral</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/bilateral.jpg">
                    <p>Bilateral arranges all the elements by centering them in the middle of the page. It is one of the more basic systems but gets straight to the point</p>
                    <p>My example image does exactly this. I added lines inbetween the paragraphs to make it a little more interesting.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="dilational">
                    <p><u>Dilational</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/dilational.jpg">
                    <p>The dilational typographic system involves one or many center points where the text wraps around these points making an almost ripple effect</p>
                    <p>My created image has several of these center points and although the points are irregular its a satisfying effect that will attract a viewers attention.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid">
                    <p><u>Grid</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/grid.jpg">
                    <p>The grid system as the name suggests organises the contained elements into a grid like shape. There can be visible or invisible margins that seperate the content from each other.</p>
                    <p>In my image there are no visible margins but you can tell the text is organised into a specific grid-like area. I chose to place the text next to this black and yellow symbol just to make the image more pleasant and engaging.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="modular">
                    <p><u>Modular</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/modular.jpg">
                    <p>In a modular typographic system elements are organised and arranged in a grid or modular structure, this is a more structured approach than "dilational" for example but at the same time it is unintresting and not the most creative.</p>
                    <p>My approach to this system involved placing the information in blocks that follow a grid-like structure. I alternated the colors to make the design more appealing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="radial">
                    <p><u>Radial</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/radial.jpg">
                    <p>Radial elements are arranged to look like they are coming out of a centeral focal point. Radial systems can be hard to read sometimes as as different lines of text are being written at different angles.</p>
                    <p>In my design i chose to only use text that reads from left to right so it is easy to read but remains interesting to an audience or viewer, like i previously mentioned this is not always the case and text can be read from multiple different angles.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="random">
                    <p><u>Random</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/random.jpg">
                    <p>As the name suggests the random typographic system follows no pattern or structure, there can be varied font sizes, overlapping and layering and an all out "random" structure.</p>
                    <p>In my image text is split up, rotated to different angles and varies in font size.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="transitional">
                    <p><u>Transitional</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/transitional.jpg">
                    <p>Transitional arranges elements into textured layers with varying tones, the layers arent always neatly alligned giving it a more relaxed feel</p>
                    <p>In my image it looks almost like an atmosphere is being created by wind blowing the text across the page, this makes the piece feel soothing to look at and satisfies the viewer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="reflecttypo">
                    <p>All in all i enjoyed this part of the project, learning about the typographic systems was fun and i liked
                        creating my own versions of each system for the specific information the task gave me. coming up with ideas of what to do for each
                        system was challenging at times but thinking of my own design for each one helped me get a deeper understanding of
                        how each individual system works and is used in graphic design.
                    </p>
                    <p>If i was to do this again i would spend longer on my own typographic system designs and make them look as high quality and profesional as i can.</p>

            <h3>As i completed foundation year last year i found that there was a lot of things that had already been covered for me so i found this project quite 
                easy and the worksheets simple to follow, however i still enjoyed this project as it helped me get practice using HTML and CSS aswell as teaching me some more about flexbox which i didnt
                understand very well last year.

            <p><u>Reflective essay!</u></p>
            <div class ="scroll-essay">
                <p> Overall I have enjoyed this project as it has given me a chance to show off my knowledge of an array of skills within graphic designing, it has also given me a chance to see what areas I need to improve upon to take my work further throughout university and afterwards. While working on the Design Fundamentals Website project I came across multiple challenges that I had to overcome to complete the assignment. I had an issue with using Adobe Indesign when I began working on the CARP section of the website as I was inexperienced with this application, through research online I managed to overcome this issue and not only am I proud of how this section turned out I enjoyed creating my own posters with their own unique style and it ended up being my favourite part of the project. Like I previously mentioned I had some experience with HTML and CSS from completing my foundation year so finishing the coding worksheets wasn’t a difficult challenge, this knowledge also helped me to code my website quicker than it would have with less experience. The typography section was new to me as I had never really considered typography as a concept but learning the different aspects of it means I notice it now in everyday life. Finding information on the different typographic systems was difficult and I ended up having to find examples to help me understand each system and how I could implement it into this section of the work and my own typographic examples. Because of that this was the most challenging section for me and I hope to gain a better understanding of how the typographic systems are used so I can improve upon the designs I created for this part of the project.
                </p>
                <p>The coding worksheets did help refresh my memory on how to create a working HTML and CSS code and once I had completed each section of the project it was a long process of putting it all together in one working flexbox website, but I managed to persevere through it and I am happy with how it turned out. All of the code for my website is useful and works as intended such as the buttons and pieces of media I added like website links and images. That being said I feel like my website is very simplistic and doesn’t include my own personal design looks wise, if I was to complete this project again I would spend more time creating the website and giving it my own unique look and style rather than keeping a basic scrolling colour scheme.
                </p>
                <p>In conclusion I believe I completed the work to a standard I am happy with but need more practice to take my work to the next level. I feel like I need to show more creativity when designing and try things outside of my comfort zone to see what sort of thing works and what doesn’t.
