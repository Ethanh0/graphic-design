                    <p><u>Axial</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/axial.jpg">
                    <p>Axial arranges elements on either side of a line or axis. Axial typographic systems are not always used on their own and can be combined with other typographic systems to make an engaging effect with the viewer.</p>
                    <p>In my image different blocks of text are arranged opposite each other, this is how the typographic system is used to draw in an audience.</p>

                <div class="bilateral">
                    <p><u>Bilateral</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/bilateral.jpg">
                    <p>Bilateral arranges all the elements by centering them in the middle of the page. It is one of the more basic systems but gets straight to the point</p>
                    <p>My example image does exactly this. I added lines inbetween the paragraphs to make it a little more interesting.</p>

                    <p><u>Dilational</u></p>
                    <img src="Images/dilational.jpg">
                    <p>The dilational typographic system involves one or many center points where the text wraps around these points making an almost ripple effect</p>
                    <p>My created image has several of these center points and although the points are irregular its a satisfying effect that will attract a viewers attention.</p>

            <h3>As i completed foundation year last year i found that there was a lot of things that had already been covered for me so i found this project quite 
                easy and the worksheets easy to follow, however i still enjoyed this project as it helped me get practice using HTML and CSS aswell as teaching me some more about flexbox which i didnt
                understand very well last year.
