            <h3>As i completed foundation year last year i found that there was a lot of things that had already been covered for me so i found this project quite 
                easy and the worksheets easy to follow, however i still enjoyed this project as it helped me get practice using HTML and CSS aswell as teaching me some more about flexbox which i didnt
                understand very well last year.
